# Alarm
Lines 15-20:
This part of the code checks if the first argument passed to the script is empty using the -z test condition. 
If it's empty, it displays a usage message explaining how to use the script to set an alarm for a specified duration, either in hours or minutes. Then it exits with a status of 0.

Line 22: After verifying the command line argument, the script uses the sleep command to wait for the specified duration provided as the command line argument.

Lines 25-31: The script then proceeds to wake you up by playing a series of alarm sounds.
It defines an array alarm containing the filenames of the alarm sounds.
It iterates over each element in the alarm array using a for loop.
For each iteration, it displays a wake-up message using figlet, then plays the corresponding alarm sound using mpv (a media player).

Lines 33-38:
After playing the alarm sound, it waits for 45 seconds (sleep 45) and then kills all instances of mpv.
Finally, it waits for an additional 5 minutes before moving on to the next iteration.
